Names: Lilah, Louis, Kayli, Sidra

Lilah's favorite species: One of my favorite species is a nudibranch. They are very colorful slug like creatures that live in the ocean! I have seen a few species of them and hope to find more. One of the coolest looking nudibranch is the blue dragon. It collects poison from Portuguese Man 'o wars to use on prey.

Louis's favorite specie : I don't actually know what my favorite specie is but right now I'm thinking about the Emerald cockroach wasp, it's a parasitoid wasp (tiny wasp) that invenomates cockroaches. Their venom is incredible it zombifies the cockroach and then the wasp will bring it to it's nest where she will lay a single egg on it that will eventually hatch and devour the whole cockroach.

Sidra's favorite specie: I think my favorite specie is orcas. It's interesting how there are two different types, resident and transient, and they have different diets. There are 3 different family groups of resident orcas in puget sound.
