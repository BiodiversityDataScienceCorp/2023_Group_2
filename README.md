Lilah's favorite species: One of my favorite species is a nudibranch. They are very colorful slug like creatures that live in the ocean! I have seen a few species of them and hope to find more. One of the coolest looking nudibranch is the blue dragon. It collects poison from Portuguese Man 'o wars to use on prey.
